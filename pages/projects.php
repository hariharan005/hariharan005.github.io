                    The CORS - Analyzer cli tool is designed to identify vulnerable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations in web applications. CORS misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information or enabling malicious activities. This tool offers a feature that allows simultaneous identification of multiple domains, which can be beneficial for both developers and bug hunters. Developers can use the tool to scan their own applications and ensure that their CORS configurations are secure. Bug hunters, on the other hand, can leverage this tool to identify vulnerable CORS domains in web applications they are testing, helping them discover and report security vulnerabilities. By using the CORS tool, developers and bug hunters can proactively address CORS misconfigurations, strengthening the security of web applications and protecting against potential attacks.
